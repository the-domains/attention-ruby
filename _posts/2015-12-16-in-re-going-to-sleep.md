In re: Going to Sleep

Going to sleep is something you'll do a lot of. Practically every day.
Except when you go backpacking across Europe -- assuming you'll be lucky enough
to get to do that. I wasn't. By the time my friends went traipsing across the
Continent my family was poor and I had to paint houses, which was all fine and
good. I wasn't jealous of my friends or anything. They probably all caught some
VD, which they deserved. 

I'll discuss VD's another
time. 

The point is that we all
sleep a lot -- some more than others, which brings up an even bigger point. If
you learn nothing else from this memo, learn that there is a huge range of
normal in our species. Normal is a broad spectrum in humans. If you're
concerned that you're not normal, you are. Consider the size of the universe
and you'll feel fine. 

Some people sleep ten or
even twelve hours a day, while others sleep 4 or possibly even 2 hours. The
extremes are extreme, of course, but it's a range and it happens. In other
words, you're fine. Probably. 

When I was your age, assuming you're 12 when you read this, I went to sleep every night listening to Simon and Garfunkel. 

[][0]

Simon and Garfunkel was a popular musical duo in the
1960's, which was a tumultuous time in America. We went from being modern to
being postmodern, which is all a bunch of crap. Postmodernism is a word that
some people made up to prove how much more special they were than their
parents. You'll probably come up with something similar. But nothing really
changed in the 1960's. Again, I'm talking about the broad spectrum here.
Everyone back then wanted to have sex with everyone else. But that has always
been true. Always. For a million years. But in the 1960's, special white
Americans started wanting to have sex with everyone all over the world -- Asians
and Latin Americans and Africans. Everyone. Except some Pacific Islanders, who
hadn't yet learned to honor their folk traditions by writing about them in
English. 

By the way, it's normal to want to have sex with someone.
Particularly once you're happily married. Dad joke! 

I wasn't alive in the 1960's, but I still wanted to have
sex with women from other cultures. And look! You're mother is Iranian, so it
all worked out. You have Simon and Garfunkel to thank for that. 

Anyway. I listened to their album every night when I was
twelve. I had it on tape. I'll discuss tapes another time. I would rewind the song
Bridge Over Troubled Water over and over and over. Certain scary, sad things
were happening in my house back then -- all of which, it turns out, are
unfortunately within that broad spectrum of normal -- and that song, Bridge Over
Troubled Water, comforted me as I went to sleep. 

Art Garfunkel sings that song, but for some reason I
thought Murphy Brown sang it. 

Murphy Brown was the title character of a sitcom that
ran from 1988 until 1998\. Murphy Brown, played by Candace Bergen, was a
middle-aged recovering alcoholic TV journalist who returned to her job after a
stay at the Betty Ford clinic only to find that her new producer was a brainy
wiz-kid half her age. Poor Miles. Will you ever win? 

I was in love with Murphy Brown. And because I thought
she sang Bridge Over Troubled Water, every night as I drifted off to sleep, I
imagined she was singing it to me. 

I was a fat, although very tan, 12 year old, and I was
in love with a middle-aged recovering alcoholic. For what it's worth, Candace
Bergen was one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood in her day, although
she was never physically my type. I prefer darker women from other cultures,
like Iran or Mexico, because I am a postmodernist.

Anyway. Here's the thing about going to sleep: it's
usually dark and silent, and you're usually alone. And if you can't sleep right
away you're left to think about your life, your day, even if you're only 12\.
And if your life is sad and scary just then, as sometimes it will be (I'm so
sorry), then going to sleep will also feel sad and scary and lonesome. I know
that for certain, because when I was a fat, albeit tan, 12 year old I felt sad
and scared but not lonesome because I had Murphy Brown. 

Kansas, where I grew up, is so dark at night. It's hard
to describe except to say it's a dark that you can't even imagine, not even
when you're in it. There's no light but there are stars. I'd stare out my
window at night, into that terrible darkness, up at the sky, and as Murphy
Brown sang to me, I'd quietly slip away into the universe. 

I hope you don't have to do that. I hope I can send you
back packing through Europe. I hope I can show you the amazing darkness of
Kansas. I hope you invent a word that makes you more special than me. I hope
you know that when you feel scared and sad, I'll be there to sing you to sleep.
