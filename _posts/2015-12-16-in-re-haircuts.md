In re: Haircuts

I call them "hairdos," as in, _I'm afraid I can't dish right now, I'm off to get my hair done. _I
say it this way to reflect the production that goes into getting my hair done.
It's a constant struggle, as you'll learn. I'm not sure if it's worse being a
girl or being a boy. Most girls I know will swear that it's more difficult for
them. That's possible. But most girls I know won't stop until everyone agrees
that their lives are much more difficult than my silly, simple life as a boy. I
can't say whether or not that's true for certain because I'm a critical
thinker. What I can say for certain is that my hairdos have been a struggle. 

I generally don't get
the usual barber cut, and I suppose that's why I've had such a hard time. Don't
get me wrong, getting your hair done can be a real pleasure. Sometimes they
give you a scalp massage. And I like the way it feels when they scrape the
little hairs off the back of my neck -- something you won't get to enjoy, I
don't think. 

Lately I've been getting
what my friends call a "lesbian hairdo." It's short on the sides and long on
top. It's also called a "high and tight." There was a singer named Lisa
Stansfield when I was younger who was a pioneer in this style of hairdo. 

My hairstyle will change
at some point -- I'm certain -- and I'll struggle with it. 

When I was your age
(assuming you're 8 when you read this), I was fat and had a flat top. I looked
like a marine who'd been assigned to a desk and had let himself go. Your
grandmother put me on a diet -- she made me eat nothing but Lean Cuisines, which
were low-calorie frozen dinners for middle-aged suburban women. When I failed
to lose weight from that, she made me grow my hair out and get a tan. Gramma
Sue always says that tan fat is better than pale fat. And you know what? She's
right. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9eb80ac1-5976-4bbc-a51a-ba79b8e1f120.jpg)

As of this writing, I
get my hair done by a guy named Tom. He's Hmong, which is pronounced MUNG. The
Hmong are an Asian people who came from the mountains around Cambodia and
Vietnam and Laos -- Southeast Asia, in other words. They were persecuted by the
Lao government in the 1970's -- hunted, really -- and so they fled their native
land. Many, like Tom and his family, came to the United States, where Tom
learned to give really great lesbian hairdos. 

When I lived in
Minnesota, a girl named Allie did my hair. She was really cute and she laughed
at all my jokes, but she gave terrible hairdos. I went to her for over five
years.
